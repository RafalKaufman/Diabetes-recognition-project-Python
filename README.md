# Diabetes-recognition-project-python
A project I worked on during my graduate studies in machine learning classes.

The goal of this project is to diagnostically predict **whether or not a patient has diabetes**, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset called "diabetes.csv" downloaded from kaggle.com. It includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and is selected form a larger dataset, so that all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
